# Dev Tunnels SSH Library
A Secure Shell (SSH2) client and server protocol library, implemented in both
C# and TypeScript.

## Feature Highlights
 - SSH over any .NET Stream or JavaScript stream (including but not limited to
   TCP socket streams)
 - Configurable, extensible, negotiated algorithms for key-exchange, encryption,
   integrity (HMAC), and public-key authentication
 - Channel multiplexing, with ability to stream data to/from channels
 - Port-forwarding, with ability to stream data to/from remote ports
 - Piping between two sessions can relay all channels and port-forwarding
 - Extensible channel request handling (for "exec", "shell", or custom requests)
 - Supports [reconnecting](./ProtocolExtensions.md) a disconnected session
   without disrupting channel streams.
 - Compatible with common SSH software. (Tested against OpenSSH.)
 - Supports importing and exporting several key formats, including
   password-protected keys.

### Limitations
The following features are not implemented in this library, though they could be built
on top of it:
 - Allowing a client to login to a user account on the server
 - Connecting to a shell on the server
 - Invoking shell commands on the server
 - Transferring files (SCP or SFTP)
 - Rendering a terminal on the client side

Future development may add support for some of these capabilities, likely in the
form of additional optional packages.

## C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 6)
The C# library targets .NET Framework 4.8, .NET Standard 2.1 (.NET Core 3.1, .NET 5),
and .NET 6. It's tested on Windows, Mac, & Ubuntu. For details about the .NET library,
see [src/cs/Ssh/README.md](./src/cs/Ssh/README.md).

## TypeScript (Node.js or Browser)
The TypeScript implementation supports either Node.js (>= 14.x) or a browser
environment. The Node.js version is tested on Windows, Mac & Ubuntu; the browser
version is tested on Chrome & Edge Chromium, though it should work in any modern
browser that supports the web crypto API. Note that since script on a web page
cannot access native TCP sockets, the standard use of SSH over TCP is not possible;
some other stream transport like a websocket may be used. For details about the
TypeScript library, see [src/ts/ssh/README.md](./src/ts/ssh/README.md).

## Packages

|                                          | C# NuGet package | TS npm package |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| SSH core protocol and crypto             | [**`Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh`**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh) | [**`@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh)
| SSH public/private key import/export     | [**`Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh.Keys`**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh.Keys/) | [**`@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh-keys`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh-keys)
| SSH TCP connections and port-forwarding  | [**`Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh.Tcp`**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DevTunnels.Ssh.Tcp/) | [**`@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh-tcp`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dev-tunnels-ssh-tcp)

The optional "keys" and "TCP" packages depend on the core package. All SSH packages
in an app must be the same major and minor version; the patch version (3rd component)
may differ if necessary. In other words, any changes that impact cross-package
dependencies will increment at least the minor version.

## Development
See [README-dev.md](README-dev.md).

## SSH Algorithms Support
Crypto algorithms below rely on platform APIs in .NET ([System.Security.Cryptography](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=netstandard-2.1
)), Node.js ([crypto module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)) or browsers ([web crypto](
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)). There is _one_ use of
a 3rd-party library: the [diffie-hellman](https://github.com/crypto-browserify/diffie-hellman)
package is required in browsers because there is no corresponding web crypto API.

[1] May require use of 3rd-party libs, though Curve25519 APIs are under
consideration for [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/14741) and
[web crypto](https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/issues/233).  
[2] OpenSSH certificate support should be possible with some work.  
[3] AES-CBC is not supported in browsers due to a [limitation](
https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/issues/73) of the web crypto API. AES-CTR or
AES-GCM works fine.

There is no plan to have built-in support for older algorithms known to be
insecure (for example SHA-1), though in some cases these can be easily added by
the application.

## Key Format Support
Support for importing and exporting keys in various formats is provided in
NuGet/npm packages separate from the core SSH functionality. Some key formats
are only implemented in _either_ the C# or TS libraries, not both.
See also [src/cs/SSH.Keys/README.md](src/cs/SSH.Keys/README.md)
or [src/ts/ssh-keys/README.md](src/ts/ssh-keys/README.md).
